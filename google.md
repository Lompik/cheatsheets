# "search term"

Force an exact-match search. Use this to refine results for ambiguous
searches, or to exclude synonyms when searching for single words.

``` example
‚Äústeve jobs‚Äù
```

# OR

Search for X or Y. This will return results related to X or Y, or both.
Note The pipe (|) operator can also be used in place of ‚ÄúOR.‚Äù

``` example
jobs OR gates / jobs | gates
```

# AND

Search for X and Y. This will return only results related to both X and
Y. Note: It doesn‚Äôt really make much difference for regular searches, as
Google defaults to ‚ÄúAND‚Äù anyway. But it‚Äôs very useful when paired with
other operators.

``` example
jobs AND gates
```

# \-

Exclude a term or phrase. In our example, any pages returned will be
related to jobs but not Apple (the company).

``` example
jobs ‚Äëapple
```

# \*

Acts as a wildcard and will match any word or phrase.

``` example
steve * apple
```

# ( )

Group multiple terms or search operators to control how the search is
executed.

``` example
(ipad OR iphone) apple
```

# $

Search for prices. Also works for Euro (‚Ç¨), but not GBP (¬£) üôÅ

``` example
ipad $329
```

# define

A dictionary built into Google, basically. This will display the meaning
of a word in a card-like result in the SERPs.

``` example
define:entrepreneur
```

# cache

Returns the most recent cached version of a web page (providing the page
is indexed, of course).

``` example
cache:apple.com
```

# filetype

Restrict results to those of a certain filetype. E.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT,
PPT, etc. Note: The ‚Äúext:‚Äù operator can also be used‚Äîthe results are
identical.

apple filetype:pdf / apple ext:pdf

AROUND(X)

Proximity search. Find pages containing two words or phrases within X
words of each other. For this example, the words ‚Äúapple‚Äù and ‚Äúiphone‚Äù
must be present in the content and no further than four words apart.

```

# blogurl <span class="tag" data-tag-name="HITMISS"><span class="smallcaps">HITMISS</span></span>

Find blog URLs under a specific domain. This was used in Google blog
search, but I‚Äôve found it does return some results in regular search.

``` example

```

Sidenote. Google blog search discontinued in

# loc:placename <span class="tag" data-tag-name="HITMISS"><span class="smallcaps">HITMISS</span></span>

Find results from a given area.

``` example

inconsistent.

Find news from a certain location in Google News.

``` example
loc:‚Äùsan francisco‚Äù apple

Sidenote. Not officially deprecated, but results are
inconsistent.

# \+ <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Force an exact-match search on a single word or phrase.

``` example

Sidenote. You can do the same thing by using double quotes around your
search.

# \~ <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Include synonyms. Doesn‚Äôt work, because Google now includes synonyms by
default. (Hint: Use double quotes to exclude synonyms.)

``` example
~apple
```

# inpostauthor <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Find blog posts written by a specific author. This only worked in Google
Blog search, not regular Google search.

``` example
inpostauthor:‚Äùsteve jobs‚Äù
```

Sidenote. Google blog search was discontinued in
2011.

# allinpostauthor <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Similar to ‚Äúinpostauthor,‚Äù but removes the need for quotes (if you want
to search for a specific author, including surname.)

``` example
allinpostauthor:steve jobs
```

# inposttitle <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Find blog posts with specific words in the title. No longer works, as
this operator was unique to the discontinued Google blog search.

``` example
intitle:apple iphone
```

# link <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Find pages linking to a specific domain or URL. Google killed this
operator in 2017, but it does still show some results‚Äîthey likely aren‚Äôt
particularly accurate though. (Deprecated in 2017)

``` example

```

# info <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Find information about a specific page, including the most recent cache,
similar pages, etc. (Deprecated in 2017). Note: The id: operator can
also be used‚Äîthe results are identical.

Sidenote. Although the original functionality of this operator is
deprecated, it is still useful for finding the canonical, indexed
version of a URL. Thanks to @glenngabe for pointing this one one\!

``` example
info:apple.com / id:apple.com
```

# daterange <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

Find results from a certain date range. Uses the Julian date format, for
some reason.

``` example

```

Sidenote. Not officially deprecated, but doesn‚Äôt seem to
work.

# phonebook <span class="tag" data-tag-name="DISCONTINUED"><span class="smallcaps">DISCONTINUED</span></span>

``` example
phonebook:tim cook
