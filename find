# find traverses the filesystem hierarchy
#  The  expression  is  made  up  of options (which affect overall operation rather than the processing of a specific file, and always return true), tests (which return a true or false value), and actions (which have side effects and return a true or false value), all separated by operators.  -and is assumed where the operator is omitted. If the expression contains no actions other than -prune, -print is performed on all files for which the expression is true.

# [options] [tests+actions]  -- group tests inside \(\) for any common action

# [Options] -regextype posix-extended, -mount or -xdev (dont descend mounted dir)

# [Actions] -exec comman {} \; for command file1; command file2 or \+ for command file1 file2

# e1 e2: Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an implied "and"; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false.
# precedence: ()> !> -not> e1 -a e2 (same as above)>e1 -o e2>e1 , e2

# To find files by case-insensitive extension (ex: .jpg, .JPG, .jpG):
find . -iname "*.jpg"

# To find directories:
find . -type d

# To find files:
find . -type f

# To find files by octal permission:
find . -type f -perm 777

# To find files with setuid bit set:
find . -xdev \( -perm -4000 \) -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -l

#Â To find files with extension '.txt' and remove them:
find ./path/ -name '*.txt' -exec rm '{}' \;

# To find files with extension '.txt' and look for a string into them:
find ./path/ -name '*.txt' | xargs grep 'string'

# To find files with size bigger than 5 Mb and sort them by size:
find . -size +5M -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -Ssh | sort -z

# To find files bigger thank 2 MB and list them:
find . -type f -size +20000k -exec ls -lh {} \; | awk '{ print $9 ": " $5 }'

# To find files modified more than 7 days ago and list file information
find . -type f -mtime +7d -ls

# To find symlinks owned by a user and list file information
find . -type l --user=username -ls

# To search for and delete empty directories
find . -type d -empty -exec rmdir {} \;

# To search for directories named build at a max depth of 2 directories
find . -maxdepth 2 -name build -type d

# To search all files who are not in .git directory
find . ! -iwholename '*.git*' -type f

# Find all files that have the same node (hard link) as MY_FILE_HERE
find . -type f -samefile MY_FILE_HERE 2>/dev/null

# find directories containing FLAC files and move them.

# find file
find \( -iname '*.html' -o -iname '*.css' \) -printf '%f -- %AT'

# Search for regex type change -regextype type
# Changes  the  regular  expression syntax understood by -regex and -iregex tests which occur later on the command line.  Currently-implemented types are emacs (this is the default), posix-awk, posix-basic, posix-egrep and posix-extended.
# Matches against the whole (relative if .) path
find . -regextype posix-extended ".*d{4}"
