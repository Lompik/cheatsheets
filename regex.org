#+begin_example
^   Matches at the start of string or start of line if multi-line mode is

    Many regex implementations have multi-line mode enabled by default.

** POSIX Character Classes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: posix-character-classes
:END:
/POSIX/ Character Classes must be used in bracket expressions,
e.g. =[a-z[:upper:]]=.

#+begin_example
[:upper:]   Matches uppercase letters. Equivalent to A-Z.
[:lower:]   Matches lowercase letters. Equivalent to a-z.
[:alpha:]   Matches letters. Equivalent to A-Za-z.
[:alnum:]   Matches letters and digits. Equivalent to A-Za-z0-9.
[:ascii:]   Matches ASCII characters. Equivalent to \x00-\x7f.
[:word:]    Matches letters, digits and underscores. Equivalent to \w.
[:digit:]   Matches digits. Equivalent to 0-9.
[:xdigit:]  Matches characters that can be used in hexadecimal codes.
[:punct:]   Matches punctuation.
[:blank:]   Matches space and tab. Equivalent to [ \t].
[:space:]   Matches space, tab and newline. Equivalent to \s.
[:cntrl:]   Matches control characters. Equivalent to [\x00-\x1F\x7F].
[:graph:]   Matches printed characters. Equivalent to [\x21-\x7E].
[:print:]   Matches printed characters and spaces. Equivalent to [\x21-\x7E].

** Groups
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: groups
:END:
#+begin_example
(foo|bar)    Matches pattern foo or bar.

(foo)        Define a group (or subpattern) consisting of pattern foo.
             Matches within the group can be referenced in a replacement
             using a backreference.

(?<foo>bar)  Define a named group named "foo" consisting of pattern bar.
             Matches within the group can be referenced in a replacement using
             the backreference $foo.

(?:foo)      Define a passive group consisting of pattern foo. Passive
             groups cannot be referenced in a replacement using a
             backreference.

(?>foo+)bar  Define an atomic group consisting of pattern foo+. Once foo+ has
             been matched, the regex engine will not try to find other variable
             length matches of foo+ in order to find a match followed by a
             match of bar. Atomic groups may be used for perforamce reasons.

** Assertions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: assertions
:END:
#+begin_example
foo(?=bar)   Lookahead assertion. The pattern foo will only match if followed
             by a match of pattern bar.

foo(?!bar)   Negative lookahead assertion. The pattern foo will only match if
             not followed by a match of pattern bar.

(?<=foo)bar  Lookbehind assertion. The pattern bar will only match if preceded
             by a match of pattern foo.

(?<!foo)bar  Negative lookbehind assertion. The pattern bar will only match if
             not preceded by a match of pattern foo.
#+end_example

** Back References
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: back-references
:END:
Back references are used in replacements.

#+begin_example
$3        Matched string within the third non-passive group.
$0 or $&  Entire matched string.
$foo      Matched string within the group named "foo".
#+end_example

** Case Modifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: case-modifiers
:END:
Case modifiers are used in replacements.

\u  Make the next character in the replacement uppercase.
\l  Make the next character in the replacement lowercase.
\U  Make the remaining characters in the replacement uppercase.
\L  Make the remaining characters in the replacement lowercase.
#+end_example

** Modifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: modifiers
:END:
Modifiers can be grouped together, e.g. =(?ixm)=.

#+begin_example
(?i)  Case insensitive mode. Make the remainder of the pattern or subpattern
      case insensitive.

(?m)  Multi-line mode. Make $ and ^ in the remainder of the pattern or
      subpattern match before/after newline.

(?s)  Single-line mode. Make the . (dot) in the remainder of the pattern or
      subpattern match newline.

(?x)  Free spacing mode. Ignore white space in the remainder of the pattern
      or subpattern.
